# Problem 1

## Which seasons have the most delays?

A delay is considered to be a departure delay length of over 9 minutes,
which is the average length of departure delays for all flights. The
table below displays the number of delayed flights per season. It
appears that Spring has the highest number of delays, while Fall
significantly has the lowest.

    ## 2 Summer   6388
    ## 3 Winter   6281
    ## 4 Fall     3185

## Does this change by destination?

We are considering only the top 10 arrival destinations for ABIA. Their
IATA codes along with the number of flights arriving there are included.

The RMSEs out of sample for 350 Trim and 65 AMG Trim are both minimized
at K = 10. This may be because 10 is around the median value for K, and
does the best at the minimizing bias-variance tradeoff.
